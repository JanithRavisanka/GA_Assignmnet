            1. First run the optimization to get the best packing plan (this saves results to a file)
            2. Then execute the simulation using the result file path from step 1
            
            IMPORTANT: The optimization tool saves results to a file and returns a file path. 
            You must pass this file path to the simulation tool, not the raw data.
